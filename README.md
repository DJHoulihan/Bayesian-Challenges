# BayesianChallenges
Coding challenges for finding parameters and their uncertainties to better fit data and predict outcomes. Challenges taken from the hands on session for the 2023 Exotic Beams Summer School https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~wrede/EBSS2023.
Put together by: Pablo Giuliani and Kyle Godbey

Solved by Dennis Houlihan using the emcee package in python rather than the made-from-scratch code developed by Pablo and Kyle.
